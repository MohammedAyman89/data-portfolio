Countries, corporations, and individual responsibility are thoroughly considered, considering major recent events, such as the Extinction Rebellion Movement and COP26. The social dynamics of sustainable change are studied, encouraging students to question what sustainability is and who is responsible for creating that change. Students will develop a range of skills, including critical thinking and writing, discussion and debating, and listening to and appreciating the range of global viewpoints brought to the table. They will be asked to consider the green and blue economy, the role of major NGOs and the grassroots player to establish a roadmap to sustainable transformation. Pre-requisiste: Acceptance onto MA course"
ILHM-506,Environmental Ethics and Justi,3,"Environmental Ethics and Justice bids students to consider a range of questions: what is our place in nature and are we central to it? What is the intersection between our treatment of nature and how we (as a Western society) have treated BAME/BIPOC peoples, including those from colonised geographies. We will critically evaluate what defines our moral relation to our own kind and to other non-human living systems, asking how value is defined. Students are also expected to investigate the extent to which wilderness has value in and of itself, and if it is possible to rewild places without changing their nature. Throughout this course, students will evaluate the human position within our limited planetary constraints, reflect on the means and processes through which we have come to oppress natural and human systems, analyse the anthropocentric values that pervade society, and ultimately offer a trajectory toward a more holistic and just future."
ILHM-510,Heritage & Community Chng Maki,3,"Heritage and Community Change-Making captures the range of transformative effects that heritage  built or natural  has on communities. Bringing together concepts surrounding social dynamics, relative deprivation, access and inclusivity, and UNESCOs CDIS and Culture|2030 Indicators, the course sets out a depth and breadth of case studies that hinge on the central commonality of cultural heritage. Students can expect to holistically pursue the change-making ability of heritage on a local, regional, and global scale, as they investigate the ramifications of cultural heritage on those around it. From tourism programmes on the steppes of Mongolia and the economic value of Northern Irelands historic landscape, to the building of military veteran resilience across the Transatlantic and heritage as a tool for peacebuilding in Southeast Asia, the fullest change-making extent of heritage is explored. Impactful case studies from around the globe are used as the launching point for understanding the power and simplicity of heritage as a transcendent human interface, while practical tasks bring global knowledge and experience back home for potent application. Pre-requisites: Graduate level course; all program entry requirements apply"
ILHM-512,Environmental Policy Analysis,3,"Environmental issues are growing in visibility in local, national, and world arenas, as a myriad of human activities leads to increased impacts on the natural world. Issues such as climate change, endangered species, wilderness protection, and energy use are regularly on the front pages of newspapers. Governments at all levels are struggling with how to address these issues. Environmental policy analysis is intended to present the environmental and social impacts of policies, in the hope that better decisions will result when people have better information on which to base those decisions. The aim of this course is to introduce students to the analysis of economic, scientific, and other data to provide objective information on environmental issues. The end goals are to create policy recommendations, promote solutions, and build public awareness."
ILHM-515,"Cult Heritage Law, Plcy Practi",3,"This course focuses on the legal and practical side of cultural heritage and cultural property management. We will unravel the range of laws and policies that govern cultural heritage  both monumental and artefactual - at the local, federal and international levels, as well as seeking deeper cultural understanding by juxtaposing it against the British system of heritage practice. The legal framework will provide the foundation on which students will begin to build up policy and processual skills. With a focal point on the practice of heritage leadership, students will engage with industry-standard cultural heritage impact assessments and write policy memos that critically evaluate illicit trading and repatriation claims in the eyes of the law. The course is designed to provide students with both depth and breadth of understanding, all directly applicable to employment and heritage leadership, directing them to explore their own ethos as practitioners and applying knowledge to real life scenarios. Class will take a range of forms, from class debates about range of historic case studies that further promote legal and cultural understanding, (including those of Kennewick Man, the Elgin Marbles, the Bamyan Buddhas, and the destruction of cultural property during the Syrian conflict), to class trips, virtual tours, guest speakers and group discussions. Pre-requisites: Graduate level course; all program entry requirements apply"
ILHM-520,"Cult Toursim, Educ and Intpn",3,"Cultural Tourism, Education and Interpretation delivers the opportunity to evaluate how cultural heritage is central to the tourism market, analysing its economic and social value, and exploring the range of best practices surrounding education and interpretation within the sector. Central to the course is the motivation behind visitor site selection and why the indulgence in both tangible and intangible cultural experiences resonates with people from across the globe. Students should be prepared to consider how heritage sites can meet growing demands sustainably and be used as a force for peacekeeping, while continuing to meet the interest and demands of their visitor attraction demographic. The spectrum of types of cultural tourism is explored, alongside practical opportunities for students to engage on a cross-cultural scale. How and why education around cultural heritage has evolved is investigated, questioning current best practice at heritage centres, museums, world heritage sites, archives and non-institutionalised spaces. Finally, students are asked to scrutinise how interpretation of cultural heritage has transformed our understanding of the past and why the identities of a society demand a proactively reflective approach to interpretative methodologies. Pre-requisites: Graduate level course; all program entry requirements apply"
ILHM-524,Heritage and Identity,1,"Heritage and Identity explores the remarkable interface between place, space, and identity, through the lens of individual, regional and national ideologies of self. Heritage has to do with everything but understanding the concept of identity and the role heritage plays in its shaping is a more elusive concept. Heritage and identity are intrinsically linked to space, place, memory and forgetting, and in many circumstances it is also linked to politicized and propagandized ideas surrounding domination and contestation. Heritage can be used to lift up and extol an identity, while in other instances it can be used to oppress or mask underlying identities. Central to this workshop will be the investigation of that transient intersection where time, place and space meet identity, and whether we can unravel the long-knotted threads that weave heritage and identity together. Ultimately, the question is posed and we will reach a determination of whether heritage informs identity, or identity informs interpretation and heritage. This is accomplished through the wide-ranging discussion of case studies, working group debates and identification of the myriad forms in which heritage and identity takes place: physical, intangible and digital.  Students will prepare a research proposal for potential article publication and conduct a heritage interview with reflective poster for this workshop that aims to be a concentrated depth dive into the ambiguous boundary between cultural heritage and identity, critical to society.  Pre-requisite: Graduate level course; all program entry requirements apply"
ILHM-525,"Herit, Equal, Divers and Incl",3,"This course will explore the relationship between heritage, EDI, and identity in individual, community, regional, and national contexts.

The module will allow students to develop a range of skills including critical thinking and writing, discussion and debating, and the ability to listen to and appreciate different viewpoints. They will be encouraged to consider heritage and EDI in relation to their own identity/ies and of those around them to help them better understand current political, social, economic, and cultural systems in the world today. Pre-requisites: Graduate level course; all program entry requirements apply"
ILHM-526,Heritage and Cultural Landscap,1,"In this graduate workshop, students will do a survey of the range of cultural landscapes and settings across the globe, toward recognition of the way heritage shapes the landscape and landscape shapes culture, including the three main categories of landscape according to the World Heritage Convention. Students will investigate the meaning of cultural landscape according to UNESCO and confront the everyday challenges of cultural landscape management. In an acknowledgement of the UNs sustainable development goals, students will form small working groups to juxtapose each others chosen landscapes and draw out the broad similarities and dissimilarities; review human impact on the landscape; reflect on that landscapes influence on how and why that culture formed; and ascertain to what extent sustainability goals are being met, hopefully developing a pathway toward sustainable development.
