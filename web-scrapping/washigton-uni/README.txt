**University Courses Catalog Scraping Example using Scrapy**

Description:
This Scrapy project extracts course catalog data from a university website. It automatically navigates department pages, follows links to individual courses, and collects structured data such as course titles, links, and departments.

Files Included:
- university_courses_spider.py (Scrapy Spider)
- courses_data.csv (Sample Output)

Skills Demonstrated:
- Multi-page crawling with Scrapy
- Following links (Rule/LinkExtractor or manual)
- Organized data pipelines
- CSV output generation
- Respectful crawling with delays

This sample demonstrates my ability to build scalable crawlers for complex site structures.
