"At least 81 people killed in Israeli strikes in Gaza, Hamas-run health ministry says",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czry8g5n80zo,"At least 81 Palestinians have been killed and more than 400 injured in Israeli strikes across Gaza in the 24 hours until midday on Saturday, the Hamas-run health ministry said.In one incident, at least 11 people, including children, were killed after a strike near a stadium in Gaza City, Al-Shifa hospital staff and witnesses told news agencies. The stadium was being used to house displaced people, living in tents.Footage verified by the BBC shows people digging through the sand with their bare hands and spades to find bodies.The Israeli military said it was ""unaware of injuries as a result of the strike"" aside from ""a suspicious individual who posed a threat"" to its forces.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said he was hopeful a ceasefire could be agreed in the next week.Qatari mediators said they hoped US pressure could achieve a deal, following a truce between Israel and Iran that ended the 12-day conflict between the countries.In March, a two-month ceasefire collapsed when Israel launched fresh strikes on Gaza. The ceasefire deal - which started on 19 January - was set up to have three stages, but did not make it past the first stage.Stage two included establishing a permanent ceasefire, the return of remaining living hostages in Gaza in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned in Israel, and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.On Thursday, a senior Hamas official told the BBC mediators have intensified their efforts to broker a new ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza, but that negotiations with Israel remain stalled.A rally was organised on Saturday evening in Tel Aviv calling for a deal to free the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Organisers said ""the time has come to end the fighting and bring everyone home in one phase"".Meanwhile, Israeli attacks in Gaza continue. Friday evening's strike near the Palestine Stadium in Gaza City killed at least 11 people, hospital staff and witnesses said.One witness said they were sitting when they ""suddenly heard a huge explosion"" after a road was hit.""This area was packed with tents - now the tents are under the sand. We spent hours digging with our bare hands,"" Ahmed Qishawi told the Reuters news agency. He said there are ""no wanted people here, nor any terrorists as they [Israelis] claim... [there are] only civilian residents, children, who were targeted with no mercy,"" he said.The BBC has verified footage showing civilians and emergency services digging through the sandy ground with their hands and spades to find bodies.Fourteen more people were reported killed, some of them children, in strikes on an apartment block and a tent in the al-Mawasi area.The strike in al-Mawasi killed three children and their parents, who died while they were asleep, relatives told the Associated Press.""What did these children do to them? What is their fault?"" the children's grandmother, Suad Abu Teima, told the news agency.More people were reported killed on Saturday afternoon after an air strike on the Tuffah neighbourhood near Jaffa School, where hundreds of displaced Gazans were sheltering. The strike killed at least eight people, including five children, the Palestinian health ministry said.One witness Mohammed Haboub told Reuters that his nephews, father and the children of his neighbours were killed in the strike.""We didn't do anything to them, why do they harm us? Did we harm them? We are civilians,"" he told the news agency.The health ministry said ambulance and civil defence crews were facing difficulties in reaching a number of victims trapped under the rubble and on the roads, due to the impossibility of movement in some of the affected areas.Asked about the strike on the Tuffah neighbourhood, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that it ""struck a suspicious individual who posed a threat to IDF troops operating in the northern Gaza Strip"".""Prior to the strike, numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians"", it said, adding that it was ""unaware of injuries as a result of the strike, besides the individual struck"".The IDF released a statement on Saturday evening saying it had killed Hakham Muhammad Issa al-Issa, a senior figure in Hamas's military wing, in the area of Sabra in Gaza City on Friday.The IDF said he was one of the founding members of Hamas's military wing, a member of Hamas's general security council, and played a ""significant role in the planning and execution"" of Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on Israel.The Israeli military launched its bombardment of Gaza in response to the attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.More than 56,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0999/live/b8653d70-5443-11f0-aa04-63f097c9ce41.jpg.webp,At_least_81_people_killed_in_Israeli_strikes_in_Ga.webp
Israel orders evacuations in northern Gaza as Trump pushes for ceasefire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg54klnyy3o,"Israel has ordered Palestinians to evacuate from parts of northern Gaza ahead of increased military action, as US President Donald Trump pushes for a ceasefire deal.People in neighbourhoods across Gaza City and Jabalia have been told to move south towards the coastal area of al-Mawasi as Israeli military operations ""intensify and expand westward"".At least 86 people were killed as the result of Israeli attacks in the 24 hours before midday on Sunday, the Hamas-run health ministry said.Three children were among those killed in a strike on the so-called ""safe zone"" of al-Mawasi, their parents said.Trump has reiterated calls to ""make the deal in Gaza"" and ""get the hostages back"".On Saturday, Trump had said on Truth Social that Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in the process of negotiating a deal with Hamas ""right now"".Meanwhile, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Avichay Adraee said on Sunday that the Israeli military was operating in north Gaza ""to eliminate terrorists and terrorist infrastructure"".Medics and residents told Reuters that military bombardments increased in Gaza in the early hours of Sunday, destroying several houses.Gaza's Hamas-run civil defence agency told news outlets that at least 23 people had been killed on Sunday alone.Medics said five people were killed in an Israeli air strike on a tent housing displaced people in al-Mawasi near the southern city of Khan Younis - an area where people in the north had been told to evacuate to.Five members of the Maarouf family, including three children, were killed.""They bombed us while we were sleeping on the ground,"" their mother Iman Abu Maarouf said. ""We didn't do anything wrong. My children were killed, and the rest are in intensive care.""Their father Zeyad Abu Maarouf told Reuters that the family had arrived in the ""safe zone"" a month ago after Israel told them to go to al-Mawasi.When asked about the incident, the IDF told the BBC it could not provide a specific response without more information, but said it ""follows international law and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm"".Also on Sunday, a 20-year-old IDF soldier, Sergeant Yisrael Natan Rosenfeld, was killed in northern Gaza.The increased Israeli military action comes as mediators begin new efforts to end the war and release the remaining hostages held by Hamas.On Thursday, a senior Hamas official told the BBC mediators have intensified their efforts to broker a new ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza, but that negotiations with Israel remain stalled.Qatari mediators have said they hope US pressure could help to achieve a deal, following a truce between Israel and Iran that ended the 12-day conflict between the countries.On Sunday, Netanyahu told members of Israel's domestic intelligence agency Shin  Bet that ""victory"" over Iran opened up many possibilities, ""first and foremost, to rescue the hostages"". ""Of course, we will also need to resolve the issue of Gaza, to defeat Hamas, but I believe we will achieve both missions. Beyond that, broad regional opportunities are opening up, in most of which - almost all - you are partners,"" he said.Trump previously said he was hopeful a ceasefire in Gaza could be agreed in the next week.In March, a two-month ceasefire collapsed when Israel launched fresh strikes on Gaza. It said it wanted to put pressure on Hamas to release its hostages.Israel also imposed a total blockade on humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza at the start of March, which it partially eased after 11 weeks following pressure from US allies and warnings from global experts that half a million people were facing starvation.That partial easing included the creation of a US and Israeli-backed aid group, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), after Israel accused Hamas of stealing aid. Hamas has denied this.GHF's aid system has been condemned by UN agencies. There have been repeated incidents of killings and injuries of Palestinians seeking aid.Juliette Touma, communications director for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, told the BBC that the new mechanism was ""a killing field"". She said the distribution of aid in an orderly way could only be done through the UN and other humanitarian organisations.GHF boss Johnnie Moore previously told the BBC World Service's Newshour he did not deny deaths near aid sites, but said ""100% of those casualties are being attributed to close proximity to GHF"" and that was ""not true"".The previous ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas - which started on 19 January - was set up to have three stages, but did not make it past the first stage.Stage two included establishing a permanent ceasefire, the return of remaining living hostages in Gaza in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned in Israel, and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.Trump has called for ongoing corruption charges against Netanyahu to be dropped, describing proceedings as a ""political witch hunt"" delaying ceasefire negotiations.On Sunday, an Israeli court accepted a request by the Israeli prime minister to delay his scheduled testimony for a week, due to diplomatic and security issues.Netanyahu was charged in 2019 with bribery, fraud and breach of trust, all of which he denies.Earlier in the week, Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid said Trump should not ""intervene in a legal process of an independent state"".Israel launched its military campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.Since then, 56,500 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/632d/live/958c4aa0-54f7-11f0-a063-0547e47ae66c.jpg.webp,Israel_orders_evacuations_in_northern_Gaza_as_Trum.webp
Three Palestinians killed during Israeli settler attack on West Bank village,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz9knl5w529o,"Three Palestinians have been shot dead after dozens of Israeli settlers attacked a Palestinian village in the occupied West Bank, Palestinian authorities say.Video footage from Kafr Malik, near Ramallah, on Wednesday night showed a car and a home on fire and Palestinians running away as gunfire is heard.The Israeli military said forces deployed to the scene found settlers and villagers throwing stones at each other. It added that several ""terrorists"" opened fire and threw stones at the forces, who returned fire and identified hits. They also arrested five Israelis.The Palestinian foreign ministry said settlers fired at villagers in their homes during what it called their ""terrorist assault"".The ministry also said Israeli forces prevented ambulance crews from reaching the wounded and obstructed fire crews from entering the village for several hours.Another villager, a 13-year-old boy, was shot dead - reportedly by Israeli troops - earlier in the week.Israel has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem - land Palestinians want, along with Gaza, for a hoped-for future state - in the 1967 Middle East war. An estimated 3.3 million Palestinians live alongside them.The vast majority of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law - a position supported by an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) last year - although Israel disputes this.""What do you expect us to do when our homes are being attacked by settlers with petrol bombs?"" asked one elderly man, sitting quietly with hundreds of other mourners on Thursday after the funerals of the three men who were killed - Murshid Nawwaf Hamayel, Mohammed Qaher al-Naji and Lutfi Sabri Bearat.Kafr Malik has been attacked numerous times in recent weeks by settlers increasingly emboldened by Israeli government ministers who often support their actions and who have endorsed the building of many more settlements.""They think they can take my land and force me to leave, but I'm not going anywhere,"" said Hamdallah Bearat, a retired professor of engineering who has lived in Kafr Malik for most of his life.For many younger Palestinians, though, the realities of an increasingly restrictive occupation and its economic consequences make life here more difficult by the day.Shortly after the incident in Kafr Malik, there was another attack in the Palestinian community of Dar Fazaa, near the village of Taybeh.Israeli human rights group B'Tselem said three people were injured and three cars were torched. It posted CCTV footage showing a group of at least 10 masked men setting one car on fire and throwing stones.""The settler violence and rampage, under the protection of the occupation army, is a political decision by the Israeli government, implemented by the settlers,"" Palestinian Vice-President Hussein al-Sheikh wrote on X.""The Israeli government's behaviour and decisions are pushing the region toward an explosion. We call on the international community to urgently intervene to protect our Palestinian people.""Since Hamas's attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which triggered the war in Gaza, more than 900 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank - a period in which more than 20 Israelis have also been killed.There has also been a sharp increase in the number and severity of settler attacks in the West Bank over the same period.The UN says there were 487 attacks by settlers resulting in casualties or property damage in the first four months of this year, including 122 in April. At least 181 Palestinians were reportedly injured by settlers in the attacks.Human rights organisations and witnesses say the Israeli military and police frequently stand by while settlers attack Palestinian towns and villages.Since the right-wing, pro-settler governing coalition headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in late 2022, it has decided to establish 49 new settlements and begin the legalisation process for seven settler outposts which were built without government authorisation, according to the Israeli anti-settlement watchdog Peace Now.Last month, Israeli ministers said 22 new settlements had been approved across the length and width of the West Bank, hailing it as a move that ""prevents the establishment of a Palestinian state that would endanger Israel"".In a separate incident on Wednesday, a 15-year-old Palestinian boy was shot and killed by Israeli forces in the town of al-Yamoun, near Jenin, the Palestinian health ministry said.The Israeli military said ""terrorists"" threw explosive devices at its forces during an operation there. Afterwards, they approached while holding additional explosives and the forces responded by opening fire, it added.In January, Israeli forces launched a large-scale operation against Palestinian armed groups in Jenin and two other governorates in the northern West Bank, which Netanyahu said aimed to ""defeat terrorism"".The UN's human rights chief said in April that the operation had destroyed entire refugee camps and makeshift medical sites, and displaced more than 40,000 Palestinians, who had been told not to return to their homes for a year.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3b2a/live/f8ece660-52a2-11f0-a2ff-17a82c2e8bc4.jpg.webp,Three_Palestinians_killed_during_Israeli_settler_a.webp
"Israeli strike at Gaza market kills 18 Palestinians, doctor and witnesses say",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly8dlzx918o,"At least 18 Palestinians have been killed after an Israeli drone strike targeted a Hamas police unit attempting to assert control over a market in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, a doctor and eyewitnesses told the BBC.Eyewitnesses said Israeli drones fired at Hamas police members, dressed in civilian clothing and wearing masks, who were confronting vendors they accused of price gouging and selling goods looted from aid trucks.The Hamas-run interior ministry condemned the strike, accusing Israel of committing ""a new crime against a police unit tasked with maintaining public order"".The Israeli military said it had struck ""several armed terrorists"" belonging to Hamas' Internal Security Forces.One eyewitness told the BBC clashes broke out on Thursday after police confronted the vendors, with the unit commander shouting: ""Either sell at a fair price or we will confiscate the goods.""Some of the vendors then ""pulled out handguns and one man had a Kalashnikov"", the eyewitness said.Israeli drones then fired two missiles, local residents said.Video footage from the aftermath shows bodies strewn on the ground and panicked shoppers screaming, as ambulances rush to attend to those injured.A doctor at Deir al-Balah's Al-Aqsa Hospital told the BBC 18 bodies were brought to the morgue there. It was not immediately clear how many of those killed were police officers.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that prior to the strike, steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians.The incident came as civilians in Gaza continued to struggle to access food, with near daily shootings reported at and around US and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) distribution sites in south and central Gaza, and the limited goods available in markets selling for highly inflated prices.The GHF - which has been accused of violating humanitarian principles by international aid groups - received a further $30m in funding on Thursday from the US, which has supported Israeli efforts to see it become the largest aid organisation in Gaza.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday accused Hamas of ""once again taking control of humanitarian aid… and stealing it from civilians"" in northern Gaza, as he gave the military two days to devise an ""action plan"" to prevent this.It came after video footage was filmed on Wednesday of a truck convoy carrying aid into northern Gaza, after entering through the Zikim gate, with armed and masked men on top.Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir shared the video on social media, saying Hamas was ""taking control of the food and goods"" and calling on Netanyahu to halt the entry of aid into Gaza.Hamas has denied stealing or profiting from aid, and Gaza's higher committee for tribal affairs - a non-Hamas affiliated committee created during the war - also dismissed Israel's ""false claims"" in a statement on Thursday.""The securing of aid has been carried out purely through tribal efforts,"" it said.At a warehouse in Gaza City on Thursday, thousands of aid parcels were distributed.Hamas political officials were present but said their role was ""supervisory"", with an NGO in charge of distributing some 6,000 food parcels.""This morning, when I woke up to the message telling me to go get aid, all my children, young and old, started singing and dancing with joy. I pray to God that this blessing remains with us,"" one woman waiting for food there said.Also on Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced its first medical shipment into Gaza since 2 March had been delivered on Wednesday.Nine trucks carrying medical supplies, 2,000 units of blood, and 1,500 units of plasma were transported without any looting ""despite the high-risk conditions"", WHO's chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. He added the amount was ""only a drop in the ocean"".The blood and plasma were delivered to Nasser Medical Complex for onward distribution to hospitals ""facing critical shortages amid a growing influx of injuries, many linked to incidents at food distribution sites"", he said.Before Thursday's strike at the market, at least 14 Palestinians had been killed and dozens injured in Israeli military attacks across Gaza since midnight, a spokesperson for the Hamas-run Civil Defence said. Rescue teams evacuated 14 bodies, including those of three Palestinians who were waiting for humanitarian aid near the Wadi Gaza bridge close to the Netzarim corridor in central Gaza.A medical source at Al-Awda Hospital nearby confirmed that three Palestinians were killed and several others injured by Israeli gunfire near the Wadi Gaza bridge.Witnesses said Israeli drones opened fire at a big crowd of civilians reportedly waiting for humanitarian aid at the time of the attack.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that overnight, a gathering was identified in an area adjacent to troops in the Netzarim corridor, and troops fired warning shots to prevent suspects from approaching them. The IDF said it was aware of reports regarding the number of injured individuals in the area, but said an initial inquiry suggested the number does not align with the IDF's information. However, the details of the incident are under additional review, the IDF added.Elsewhere, five people were killed in an Israeli air strike on a school sheltering displaced families in western Gaza City. In the Al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis, in the south of the Strip, five members of the Abu Arab family were killed when an Israeli air strike hit a tent sheltering displaced persons. Another Palestinian was also killed in a strike that hit a tent in Al-Mawasi. Others were wounded in the strikes.The IDF said it was looking into these reports, but requested specific coordinates and times. In general, the IDF said it was ""operating to dismantle Hamas military capabilities"".The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 56,259 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/baf6/live/5e0b7d40-52a8-11f0-90c3-576318da68e3.jpg.webp,Israeli_strike_at_Gaza_market_kills_18_Palestinian.webp
GHF boss defends Gaza aid operation after hundreds of Palestinians killed near sites,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20rz63g1zko,"The head of a controversial US and Israeli-backed aid group has defended its work after repeated incidents of killings and injuries of Palestinians seeking aid.Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) boss Johnnie Moore told the BBC World Service's Newshour he was not denying deaths near aid sites, but said ""100% of those casualties are being attributed to close proximity to GHF"" and that was ""not true"". He accused the UN and other international organisations of spreading information they could not verify. The GHF aid system has been condemned by UN agencies, and on Friday UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres branded it ""inherently unsafe"". ""Any operation that channels desperate civilians into militarized zones is inherently unsafe. The search for food must never be a death sentence,"" the UN chief said.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 500 Palestinians have been killed and 4,000 injured on their way to get aid since GHF took over aid distribution.Within days of GHF operations starting in late May, dozens of Palestinians were killed in separate incidents on 1 and 3 June, sparking international condemnation. Since then, the UN and aid groups have expressed alarm at the near-daily reports of Palestinians being killed near the GHF's sites, which are inside Israeli military zones.Eyewitnesses and medics have on several occasions described Israeli forces opening fire on crowds near aid points.Israeli newspaper Haaretz published a story on Friday in which unnamed IDF soldiers said they were ordered to shoot at unarmed civilians near aid distribution sites, to drive them away or disperse them.Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly rejected the report calling the allegations ""malicious falsehoods"".In a statement to the BBC, the IDF said it ""did not instruct the forces to deliberately shoot at civilians, including those approaching the distribution centres"".It added it was looking to improve ""the operational response"" in the aid areas and had recently added new fencing and signage, and opened new routes to reach the handout zones.For his part, the head of the GHF said ""100% of the casualties are being attributed to the IDF - as best as we can tell that's also not true"".In statements over the past month, the IDF have several times said they fired ""warning shots"" at individuals who they described as ""suspects"" or claimed posed a threat.""We spend an extended period of time trying to understand what actually happened, if anything actually happened and whether there's a way that we can make it less likely to happen,"" Mr Moore said.""In most circumstances we haven't been able to identify anything happening.""""People need to understand that it is disinformation that people going to GHF sites are being killed, we have no evidence of that happening in proximity to our sites,"" he added.Israel does not allow international news organisations, including the BBC, to send journalists into Gaza, which limits our ability to verify what is happening on the ground in the territory.Mr Moore alleged that prior to GHF's operations the majority of UN aid trucks were being hijacked at gunpoint.The UN has said there is no evidence for a large-scale hijacking of its aid trucks. When told this, Mr Moore said the ""UN is not being honest"".The volume of aid entering Gaza is still considered inadequate, despite Israel last month partially easing an 11-week blockade introduced in March. Experts have warned the territory remains on the brink of famine.The GHF is hoping to reach the milestone of providing 50 million meals in Gaza, which would equate to less than a meal a day per person since operations began.When pushed on whether food was really getting to the people who needed it most, Mr Moore admitted the operation was ""insufficient"", but said 50 million meals was more than had been available a month ago.He said the GHF needs to scale up and hopefully work with organisations such as the UN.""The mission is clear. We just want to feed Gazans,"" he added.On Thursday, the US State Department announced $30m (£22m; €26m) in funding for the GHF, which is its first known direct contribution to the group.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.More than 56,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/84d1/live/1eed42b0-5375-11f0-9fdf-1397077316aa.jpg.webp,GHF_boss_defends_Gaza_aid_operation_after_hundreds.webp
Israeli military investigates 'reports of harm to civilians' after hundreds killed near Gaza aid sites,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9vveg0vp9o,"The Israeli military has said it is examining reports of civilians being ""harmed"" while approaching aid distribution centres in Gaza run by the US- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.Since GHF operations began in late May, following a three-month Israeli blockade on Gaza, there have been almost daily reports from medics, eyewitnesses and the Hamas-run health ministry of Israeli fire killing people seeking aid at these sites.The UN says more than 400 Palestinians have been killed while seeking aid.The Israeli military said on Monday instructions had been issued to forces after ""lessons learned"", but did not specify what these lessons were.The IDF has on numerous occasions said it has fired what it has described as ""warning shots"" on ""suspects"" approaching its troops.Multiple Israeli media outlets, including the Times of Israel, reported on Monday that the IDF had acknowledged that some Palestinians had been killed while seeking aid, but that the IDF said Hamas's casualty figures were inaccurate. Israeli media reported that the military had admitted that in some cases ""inaccurate"" fire by Israeli forces had led to casualties and some deaths.The BBC put these points to the IDF, which said in response that ""reports of incidents of harm"" were being ""examined"" and that ""any allegation of a deviation from the law or IDF directives will be thoroughly examined and further action will be taken as necessary.""It said it had no further comment regarding the claims made in Israeli media on Monday.However it denied any allegations of deliberate fire at civilians, such as those raised in a report by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz on Friday.That report quoted unnamed IDF soldiers who said they were ordered to shoot at unarmed civilians near aid distribution sites, to drive them away or disperse them.Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly rejected the report, calling the allegations ""malicious falsehoods"".The GHF aid system has been condemned by UN agencies, and on Friday UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres branded it ""inherently unsafe"". It is intended to bypass the UN as the main supplier of aid to Palestinians. Israel and the US said the system would prevent aid being stolen by Hamas, which the group denies doing.Within days of GHF operations starting in late May, dozens of Palestinians were killed in separate incidents on 1 and 3 June, sparking international condemnation.On Friday GHF boss Johnnie Moore told the BBC he was not denying reports of deaths near aid sites, but said ""100% of those casualties are being attributed to close proximity to GHF"" and that was ""not true"".Israel does not allow international news organisations, including the BBC, to send journalists into Gaza.In its statement on Monday, the IDF said it was reorganising access to the sites and this would include new ""fencing"" and signposting, including directional and warning signs. This was aimed at ""improving the operational response in the area, minimising friction with the population, and ensuring that the aid reaches its intended recipients"", it said.It also said it had decided to close an aid distribution centre in the Tel al-Sultan area near Rafah in southern Gaza to establish a new one nearby.Last week the US State Department announced $30m (£22m) in funding for the GHF, which is its first known direct contribution to the group. Israel partially eased its three-month blockade of Gaza following pressure from US allies and warnings from global experts that half a million people were facing starvation.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.More than 56,500 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b329/live/0067a6b0-55e5-11f0-9932-89f9624455b1.jpg.webp,Israeli_military_investigates_reports_of_harm_to_c.webp
"Israeli strike on Gaza seafront cafe kills at least 20 Palestinians, witnesses and rescuers say",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62884y1pl5o,"At least 20 Palestinians were killed in an Israeli air strike that hit a popular seafront cafe frequently used by activists, journalists, and local residents in western Gaza City on Monday, according to medics and eyewitnesses.Rescue teams evacuated 20 bodies and dozens wounded from Al-Baqa Cafeteria, an outdoor venue which consisted of tents along the beach, a spokesperson for Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence told the BBC.He added that emergency crews were still searching through a deep crater left by the explosion.The Israeli military later said it struck ""several Hamas terrorists"" in northern Gaza and that it was reviewing the incident.""I was on my way to the café to use the internet just a few meters away when a massive explosion hit,"" said Aziz Al-Afifi, a cameraman with a local production company, told the BBC.""I ran to the scene. My colleagues were there, people I meet every day. The scene was horrific - bodies, blood, screaming everywhere.""Videos posted by activists on social media appeared to show the moment a missile, reportedly fired from an Israeli warplane, struck the area. Footage captured the aftermath of the attack, with bodies scattered across the ground.Al-Baqa Cafeteria had become a well-known space for journalists, activists, and remote workers, offering internet access, seating, and workspace along Gaza's Mediterranean coast.The Israeli military said in a statement that the strike targeted Hamas operatives, but it did not identify them. ""Prior to the strike, steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians using aerial surveillance,"" it added. ""The incident is under review.""The attack came after Israel carried out a wave of air strikes across the Gaza Strip overnight, triggering the mass displacement of hundreds of Palestinian families, witnesses said.Rescue teams recovered the bodies of five people, while dozens of injured civilians were evacuated to Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City, according to local reports.The bombardment follows one of the largest evacuation orders issued since the war resumed in March.It comes amid increasing pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to refocus efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement.On Saturday, US President Donald Trump said on social media that Netanyahu was working on negotiating a deal with Hamas ""right now"". That came days after a senior Hamas official said mediators had intensified their efforts to broker a new ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza, but that negotiations with Israel remain stalled. A two-month ceasefire collapsed in March when Israel launched fresh strikes on Gaza. The ceasefire deal - which started on 19 January - was meant to have three stages, but did not make it past the first stage.Israel followed this with a total blockade on humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza, which it partially eased after 11 weeks following pressure from US allies and warnings of starvation from global experts.The partial easing saw the creation of the controversial US- and Israeli-backed aid group, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). Since GHF took over distribution operations, there have been almost daily incidents of killings and injuries of Palestinians seeking aid. Eyewitnesses and medics have blamed Israel, though Israel has said it has only fired warning shots towards people it considered a threat.Residents in Gaza City said dozens of Israeli air raids targeted densely populated eastern neighbourhoods, including Shujaiya, Tuffah, and Zeitoun.Videos posted by activists on social media captured scenes of chaos and explosions illuminating the night sky, followed by flames and thick plumes of smoke rising above the skyline.One of the strikes reportedly hit a school in Zeitoun that had been sheltering displaced families.""Explosions never stopped... it felt like earthquakes,"" Salah, 60, from Gaza City told Reuters news agency.""In the news we hear a ceasefire is near, on the ground we see death and we hear explosions,"" the father of five added.The five fatalities reportedly occurred in a strike at the Al Shati camp, to the west of Gaza City.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had earlier ordered residents to leave large parts of northern Gaza, in anticipation of the attacks. Most of those displaced overnight moved westwards within Gaza City rather than to the southern region as instructed by the IDF.""We had no choice but to leave everything behind,"" said Abeer Talba, a mother of seven who fled Zeitoun with her family.""We got phone calls recordings in Arabic telling us we were in a combat zone and must evacuate immediately.""This is the seventh time we've been forced to flee,"" she added. ""We're in the streets again, no food, no water. My children are starving. Death feels kinder than this.""Amid the growing humanitarian crisis, fears are mounting that the evacuation orders and sustained air strikes are part of a broader Israeli plan to expand its ground offensive deeper into Gaza.But there is also speculation in Israeli media that some generals are close to concluding that military operations in Gaza are near to being achieved.
